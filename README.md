# RGB-to-JPEG Converter

This application listens for incoming `ImageRawAny` messages, compresses each frame using TurboJPEG, and publishes the
result as an `ImageJpeg` message.

## ðŸ“¦ Features

- Receives raw image frames in any supported format (`RGB888`, `RGBA8888`, `YUV420`, `YUV422`, `YUV444`)
- Compresses each frame using libjpeg-turbo (`turbojpeg` crate)
- Publishes JPEG-compressed frames to the make87 message bus
- Reuses a single JPEG compressor for performance
- JPEG quality is configurable via a config value

## ðŸ”§ Configuration

| Name           | Required | Default | Description                           |
|----------------|----------|---------|---------------------------------------|
| `JPEG_QUALITY` | No       | `90`    | JPEG quality (0â€“100, higher = better) |

## ðŸ“¥ Input

Subscribes to the `RAW_FRAME` topic and expects messages of type `ImageRawAny`.  
Supported variants:
- `ImageRGB888`
- `ImageRGBA8888`
- `ImageYUV420`
- `ImageYUV422`
- `ImageYUV444`

## ðŸ“¤ Output

Publishes to the `JPEG_FRAME` topic as `ImageJpeg` messages. Each message retains the original header and includes the
JPEG-compressed image data.

## ðŸ’¡ Notes

- Compression is done with a persistent `Compressor` to reduce allocation overhead.
- The app uses `receive_async()` and does not buffer or drop frames.
- For 4K input images, each JPEG output is typically 300â€“800 KiB depending on quality.
- This app is intended for one-to-one conversion â€” it does not perform resizing, scaling, or additional image
  preprocessing.
